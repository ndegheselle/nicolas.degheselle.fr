Versatile application framework built on Svelte, offering server-side rendering, routing. For fast, efficient web applications with minimal boilerplate.
With Svelte5 I am not fan of having both the old and new syntax which can be confusing at times.

## Feedback

- Clearly not mean for simple SPA. Handling navigation, middleware, ... only on the client side is somewhat cumbersome
- Also class are not reactive then used in a state, you need to declare the properties of the class as states
